# Ripple Go


#### Description: 
An app designed to encourage people to become more physically active by going on walks or runs. Depending on how far you've walked/ran you claim xrp rewards with potential to integrate other activities. Completing a workout/walk/run guarantees rewards but you can also solve a puzzle after to get more rewards e.g. x10, x20. The interface could have different workout plans like "couch to 5k" and by completing your plan every day you can get extra rewards. A marketplace where you can trade your collected xrp for different items from companies who are project collaborators/partners/sponsors. 

#### Objective: 
Making people more active and encouraging them to go outside and on walks/runs. Aiming to make fitness more rewarding and fun with extra mental challenges while introducing the cryptocurrency.
